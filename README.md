Neuron is a simple chat room script in python. Neuron uses AES encryption for secured data transfer over public network. It consist of two scripts a server and a client. Run the server.py in a system so that the client neuron.py can connect from remote systems with the correct password. You can connect multiple neuron.py to one single server from remote systems for a group chat. You can edit neuron.conf and change password, host, port and view mode.
